                        Vermin supreme was born June 3 1961 near boston and graduated Gloucester High School, he dropped out of a Baltimore art school after that. In the 1990’s he legally had his name changed to Vermin supreme, and is currently+ a satirical political candidate who has run in all levels of election since 2004 and has run as a Republican, Democrat, Independant, and Libertarian. He considers himself an anarchist leaning friendly facist who does know what is best for you.

                    Mr. Supreme gained notoriety for glitterbombing anti-gay politician Randall Terry in 2011 to “Turn him gay” and has had a cult online following ever since. He is most recognizable by the rubber boot he is nearly always wearing on his head and he springs back into the public’s attention usually every presidential race but also runs for various county and state positions in the downtime, or participates in various protests.

                    I seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and are not forced to sacrifice their values for the benefit of others. I believe that respect for individual rights is the essential precondition for a free and prosperous world, that force and fraud must be banished from human relationships, and that only through freedom can peace and prosperity be realized.
                    Consequently, I will always defend each person’s right to engage in any activity that is peaceful and honest, and welcome the diversity that freedom brings. The world I seek to build is one where individuals are free to follow their own dreams, in their own ways, without interference from the government or any other authoritarian power. With honesty, empathy, courage, and free ponies for everyone, I will lead past, present, and future America to the pinnacle of freedom under the rule of the one and only Tyrant You Can Trust"

            <h2>Ponynomics</h2>
            <p>
                Vermin Supreme will implement the Absolutely Free Federal Pony Identification Program (AFPIP). The first step of this program will be to make ponies very small. There are already scientists working on this feat, so there is no need to worry about the efficacy of such a plan. The next step will be implemented when tiny ponies and universal pony ownership have been achieved.
                All pony related industries will surge, including saddle makers, alfalfa farmers, blacksmith sectors.  Almost extinct jobs like buggy whip makers will see a return to the job market. Factories that produce American made novelty pony hats, and oversized pony sunglasses will go into overdrive.  Because all buildings in America will be required to be pony accessible, a multitude of jobs will be created in the trade industries.
            </p>

            <h2>Mandatory Toothbrushing</h2>
            <p>
                America has been suffering a great moral and oral decay – in spirit and incisors. Gingivitis has been eroding the gum line of this great nation long enough. To combat this epidemic, all police officers will be incarcerated for perpetuating these foul-smelling behaviors. The police force will be replaced with moral hygienists. These moral hygienists will conduct regular inspections of all individuals, seeking out any traces of literal or ethical gingivitis.

            <h2> Kangaroo Courts</h2>
            <p>
                Vermin Supreme will therefore redefine “crime” as: any act that disagrees with, denies, or otherwise opposes Vermin’s enforced freedoms (including but not limited to traveling without your pony or not flossing your teeth) and any act that causes harm to another person or people. All police officers will be incarcerated alongside the violent criminals for performing criminal acts previously not described as “crimes”. Every inmate will be offered the opportunity to restore Vermin’s favor with them by voluntarily undergoing zombification with the intent of working in the treadmill electricity farm. here will be a council of Vermins – past, present, and future – who have used the power of time travel to determine the validity of all charges.

        <div class = "policies" id = "zombie">
            <h2>Zombie Power</h2>
            <p>
                President Supreme will do away with widely used sources of energy that are detrimental to pony habitats. These sources will be replaced with infinite and renewable zombie power.
                State and local politicians are always talking about the good they can do for their communities. Vermin Supreme knows that the best way for these people to benefit their communities is to provide them with cost effective and environmentally friendly energy. After the initial switch to zombie power, any and all individuals who go against the newly defined Vermin Law will provide additional power to the grid.
